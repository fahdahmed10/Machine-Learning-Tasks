üî¨ Research Overview
Breast cancer is a leading global health challenge, with early detection being critical for improving patient survival rates. This project leverages the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset to develop and evaluate machine learning models for binary classification of breast tumors. The dataset, derived from fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsy images, provides a rich set of features for predictive modeling. The research pipeline, implemented in the Jupyter notebook eda.ipynb, includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation, with a focus on interpretability and minimizing false negatives to ensure clinical reliability.

üéØ Research Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:

High-Accuracy Classification: Develop models to accurately distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.
Feature Importance Analysis: Identify and interpret key features driving model predictions.
Overfitting Mitigation: Assess and address overfitting to ensure robust generalization to unseen data.
Interpretability: Provide detailed performance metrics and visualizations to support clinical decision-making.
Reproducibility: Create a well-documented and reproducible pipeline for further research or deployment.


üìä Dataset Description
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset contains 569 samples with 32 attributes, including:

ID: Unique identifier (non-predictive, excluded from modeling).
Diagnosis: Target variable (M = malignant, B = benign).
Features: 30 numerical features computed from digitized FNA images, grouped into three categories (mean, standard error, and worst) for each of the following:
Radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
Perimeter: Tumor boundary length.
Area: Tumor area.
Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths.
Compactness: Perimeter¬≤ / Area - 1.0.
Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour.
Concave Points: Number of concave portions.
Symmetry: Tumor symmetry.
Fractal Dimension: "Coastline approximation" - 1.



The dataset is balanced, with 357 benign (62.7%) and 212 malignant (37.3%) cases, and is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Loading: The dataset is loaded using pandas from data/breast_cancer.csv.
Encoding: The diagnosis column is encoded as binary (M = 1, B = 0) for classification.
Feature Selection: The id column is dropped, and all 30 numerical features are retained initially.
Train-Test Split: Data is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn with a random state of 42 for reproducibility.
Scaling: Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent scales across models.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) and data shape (569 rows, 32 columns) are computed to understand feature distributions.
Visualizations:
Correlation matrices to identify feature interdependencies.
Histograms and box plots to assess feature distributions and outliers.
Pair plots to explore relationships between features and the target variable.



Feature Selection
Feature selection was performed to identify the most predictive attributes, reducing model complexity and improving interpretability. A combination of correlation analysis and feature importance from tree-based models (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) was used. The top selected features include:

radius_worst: The largest tumor radius, strongly correlated with malignancy due to larger tumors often being malignant.
perimeter_worst: The maximum tumor perimeter, closely related to radius and indicative of tumor size.
area_worst: The largest tumor area, a key indicator of tumor growth.
concave points_worst: The maximum number of concave portions, reflecting irregular tumor shapes associated with malignancy.
concavity_mean: The average severity of concave portions, capturing tumor contour irregularities.
texture_worst: The maximum texture variation, indicating heterogeneity in tumor appearance.
smoothness_worst: The maximum local variation in radius, reflecting tumor surface irregularity.

These features were selected based on their high correlation with the target variable and importance scores from RandomForestClassifier, ensuring that the models focus on biologically relevant characteristics.
Model Training and Evaluation
Seven machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression: A linear model for baseline performance.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier: A scalable linear model with hinge loss.
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A kernel-based model for non-linear classification.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier: A distance-based model sensitive to feature scaling.
Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model for capturing non-linear relationships.
XGBoost Classifier: A gradient-boosting model for high performance.
RandomForest Classifier: An ensemble of decision trees, saved as the champion model due to its robustness.

Training Process:

Models were trained on the scaled training set using default or tuned hyperparameters (e.g., RandomForest with n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, min_samples_split=3, min_samples_leaf=5, max_features='log2', class_weight='balanced', random_state=42).
Performance was evaluated using accuracy on both training and test sets.
Confusion matrices were generated to analyze TP, TN, FP, and FN.
The RandomForestClassifier was saved as models/RandomForestClassifier.pkl for its balance of performance and generalizability.

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions.
Confusion Matrix: Detailed breakdown of classification outcomes.
Overfitting Analysis: Comparison of train vs. test accuracy to detect overfitting.

Overfitting Analysis
Overfitting occurs when a model performs significantly better on the training set than on the test set, indicating poor generalization. The analysis of train vs. test accuracy reveals:

KNeighborsClassifier: Achieves 100% training accuracy but 98.84% test accuracy, suggesting overfitting. The perfect training performance indicates the model may memorize the training data, particularly due to its sensitivity to local patterns in the feature space. Scaling and feature selection mitigate this, but caution is needed for deployment.
XGBClassifier: High training accuracy (99.13%) compared to test accuracy (97.67%) suggests mild overfitting. The gradient-boosting approach captures complex patterns but may overfit without further regularization.
SVC: Balanced performance (97.96% train, 98.84% test) indicates excellent generalization, likely due to the kernel-based approach and regularization.
RandomForestClassifier: Moderate train-test gap (98.54% train, 96.51% test) suggests controlled overfitting, mitigated by hyperparameters like max_depth=5 and min_samples_leaf=5. This makes it a robust choice for deployment.
LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier: Show small train-test gaps, indicating good generalization, though test accuracies are slightly lower than SVC and KNN.

Key Insight: SVC and RandomForestClassifier are the most reliable for deployment due to their balance of high test accuracy and controlled overfitting. False negatives (FN) are critical in this medical context, as missing a malignant case could delay treatment. Confusion matrices provide detailed insights into FN rates.
Confusion Matrix Visualizations
Confusion matrices are saved in the plots folder as PNG files, providing a detailed view of classification performance:

True Positives (TP): Malignant cases correctly identified.
True Negatives (TN): Benign cases correctly identified.
False Positives (FP): Benign cases misclassified as malignant (less critical but undesirable).
False Negatives (FN): Malignant cases misclassified as benign (critical to minimize).

Available Plots:

plots/Comparison.png: Comparative overview of all models.
plots/Confusion_metric_for_DecisionTreeClassifier.png: Balanced TP/TN, few FN.
plots/Confusion_metric_for_KNN.png: High TP/TN, minimal FN, but overfitting risk.
plots/Confusion_metric_for_LogisticRegression.png: Moderate FN, stable performance.
plots/Confusion_metric_for_RandomForestClassifier.png: Balanced, few FN, suitable for deployment.

plots/Confusion_metric_for_SVC.png: High TP/TN, minimal FN, robust performance.
